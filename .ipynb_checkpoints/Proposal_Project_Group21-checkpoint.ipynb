    "# Abstract \n",
    "This study aims to optimize scheduling and resource allocation techniques using Genetic Algorithms (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and Dynamic Programming (DP). We will utilize the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to build machine-learning models for predicting breast cancer malignancy based on cell features from fine needle aspirate images. Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, standardizing data, and using predictive modeling techniques for imputation. Following data preprocessing, feature engineering methods such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and feature importance scores, are used to identify key predictive features.  The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score to prevent overfitting and accurately measure how well the model performs on unseen data. By integrating AI and machine learning techniques, this study aims to create models that can assist medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer more effectively, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes.

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women worldwide. Early detection and prompt treatment are crucial for successful outcomes. However, traditional diagnostic methods relying on manual interpretation of histopathological images by healthcare providers are prone to subjectivity and variability. These limitations highlight the demand for more objective and efficient diagnostic approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several studies have explored the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis. For example, Kim (2019) utilized machine learning algorithms to predict breast cancer malignancy based on histopathological images <a name=\"Kim, Dong Wook\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#Kim). Similarly, Esteva (2017) developed a deep learning model for diagnosing breast cancer using biopsy images <a name=\"Esteva, Andre\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#Esteva). These studies demonstrate the potential of machine learning in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in breast cancer diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated the success of feature selection techniques in optimizing machine learning models for breast cancer diagnosis. Ebtisam (2020) applied feature selection methods to identify the most relevant features for predicting breast cancer malignancy <a name=\"Ebtisam, Hamed\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#Ebtisam). Additionally, Amazona (2019) used Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select key features for diagnosing breast cancer <a name=\"Amazona, Adorada\"></a>[<sup>[5]</sup>](#Amazona).\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these achievements, there is still a need for comprehensive research in optimizing scheduling and resource allocation techniques. Through meticulous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, this research seeks to advance the objectivity, efficiency, and accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis, ultimately improving patient outcomes."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem addressed in this study is to optimize breast cancer diagnosis by using advanced machine learning techniques to accurately predict the malignancy in breast cancer samples. To address this challenge, we plan to use algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Neural Networks, to analyze cell features extracted from fine needle aspirate images. Our focus will be on using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which includes attributes like Clump Thickness, Uniformity of Cell Size, and Marginal Adhesion. Through this analysis, our goal is to develop predictive models that can assist medical professionals in early and accurate diagnosis.  Moreover, the problem is quantifiable, as we can measure model performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score. Through quantitative assessment and comparison with established benchmarks, our study aims to deliver a reliable and reproducible solution for enhancing breast cancer diagnosis."

    "\n",
    "The primary goal is to accurately predict the malignancy of breast cancer samples based on several cell features. Below are the key components and methodologies of our proposed solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Machine Learning Models**: We will employ various machine learning models including Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Neural Networks. These models are chosen due to their proven effectiveness in handling binary classification tasks like cancer diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering and Selection**:\n",
    "   - **Handling Missing Data**: We will address missing values in the 'Bare Nuclei' feature using predictive modeling, possibly employing a simpler classifier to impute these values.\n",
    "   - **Feature Selection Techniques**: To identify the most predictive features, we will use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and feature importance scores from ensemble methods like Random Forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimization Algorithms**:\n",
    "   - **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**: Inspired by evolutionary biology, GA will be used for feature selection to optimize the subset of features that results in the best predictive performance.\n",
    "   - **Simulated Annealing**: This technique will be explored to optimize hyperparameters of the chosen models, enhancing the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**:\n",
    "   - While RL is typically not used in static classification tasks, we propose a novel approach by treating the feature selection process as an episodic reinforcement learning problem, where the agent's actions involve selecting or excluding features, and rewards are based on model accuracy and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation Strategy**:\n",
    "   - We will continuously evaluate the models during the training process using a validation set, and finally on a separated test set to ensure that our models generalize well beyond the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating these sophisticated AI and machine learning techniques, our project aims not only to achieve high accuracy in breast cancer diagnosis but also to push forward the methodological boundaries by exploring how strategies from different subfields of AI can enhance traditional predictive modeling."

Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).-->\n",
    "\n",
    "To robustly evaluate the performance of our machine learning models on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) dataset, we propose using the following metrics specifically chosen to capture both the accuracy and reliability of the diagnostic predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accuracy**: This is a straightforward indicator of how often the model correctly identifies cancer status. It provides the proportion of total correct predictions (both benign and malignant) out of all predictions made.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Confusion Matrix-derived Metrics**:\n",
    "   - **Precision**: Measures the proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct, crucial for minimizing false alarms in medical diagnostics.\n",
    "   - **Recall** (Sensitivity): Measures the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified, essential for detecting as many true cases of cancer as possible.\n",
    "   - **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two in cases of class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ROC-AUC Score**: This metric will help understand the trade-offs between true positive rate and false positive rate, which is crucial for medical diagnostics where the consequences of both types of errors are significant. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) provides a single measure of overall model performance across all classification thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics will be computed using a cross-validated approach to ensure robustness against overfitting and provide a realistic estimation of the model’s performance on unseen data. This comprehensive evaluation strategy will allow us to compare the performance of different models and configurations accurately, ensuring the selection of the best model and settings for deployment."
