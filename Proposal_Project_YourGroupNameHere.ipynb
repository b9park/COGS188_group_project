    "\n",
    "You have the choice of doing either (1) an AI solve a problem style project or (2) run a Special Topics class on a topic of your choice.  This repo is assuming you want to do (1).  If you want to do (2) you should fill out the Gradescope proposal for that instead of using this repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like 8-Queens or a small Traveling Salesman Problem or similar\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem (e.g., RL) that interacts with a simulator or live task, then the problem will have a reasonably complex action space. For instance, a wupus world kind of thing with a 9x9 grid is definitely too small.  A simulated mountain car with a less complex 2-d road and simplified dynamics seems like a fairly low achievement level.  A more complex 3-d mountain car simulation with large extent and realistic dynamics, sure sounds great!\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem that uses a dataset, then the dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "- The project must include some elements we talked about in the course\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "The primary goal is to accurately predict the malignancy of breast cancer samples based on several cell features. Below are the key components and methodologies of our proposed solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Machine Learning Models**: We will employ various machine learning models including Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Neural Networks. These models are chosen due to their proven effectiveness in handling binary classification tasks like cancer diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering and Selection**:\n",
    "   - **Handling Missing Data**: We will address missing values in the 'Bare Nuclei' feature using predictive modeling, possibly employing a simpler classifier to impute these values.\n",
    "   - **Feature Selection Techniques**: To identify the most predictive features, we will use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and feature importance scores from ensemble methods like Random Forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimization Algorithms**:\n",
    "   - **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**: Inspired by evolutionary biology, GA will be used for feature selection to optimize the subset of features that results in the best predictive performance.\n",
    "   - **Simulated Annealing**: This technique will be explored to optimize hyperparameters of the chosen models, enhancing the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**:\n",
    "   - While RL is typically not used in static classification tasks, we propose a novel approach by treating the feature selection process as an episodic reinforcement learning problem, where the agent's actions involve selecting or excluding features, and rewards are based on model accuracy and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation Strategy**:\n",
    "   - We will continuously evaluate the models during the training process using a validation set, and finally on a separated test set to ensure that our models generalize well beyond the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating these sophisticated AI and machine learning techniques, our project aims not only to achieve high accuracy in breast cancer diagnosis but also to push forward the methodological boundaries by exploring how strategies from different subfields of AI can enhance traditional predictive modeling."

    "1. **Accuracy**: This is a straightforward indicator of how often the model correctly identifies cancer status. It provides the proportion of total correct predictions (both benign and malignant) out of all predictions made.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Confusion Matrix-derived Metrics**:\n",
    "   - **Precision**: Measures the proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct, crucial for minimizing false alarms in medical diagnostics.\n",
    "   - **Recall** (Sensitivity): Measures the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified, essential for detecting as many true cases of cancer as possible.\n",
    "   - **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two in cases of class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ROC-AUC Score**: This metric will help understand the trade-offs between true positive rate and false positive rate, which is crucial for medical diagnostics where the consequences of both types of errors are significant. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) provides a single measure of overall model performance across all classification thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics will be computed using a cross-validated approach to ensure robustness against overfitting and provide a realistic estimation of the model’s performance on unseen data. This comprehensive evaluation strategy will allow us to compare the performance of different models and configurations accurately, ensuring the selection of the best model and settings for deployment."
